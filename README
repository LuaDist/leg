Leg 0.1.2
=========

This is a release of Leg, a Lua library exporting a complete Lua 5.1 grammar 
and a small API for user manipulation.


Dependencies
------------

* You need, understandably, to have Lua 5.1 up and running to be able to use
this library :)

* Also, Leg uses LPeg 0.7 extensively for pattern matching, so LPeg is 
expected be installed. You can get LPeg at 

http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg.html


Basic Installation
------------------

There are three ways to install Leg:

* `make` or `make leg`
  
  A directory `leg` will be created in your working directory, with the 
  source files inside. Just put it in a LUA_PATH-visible place and you're 
  ready to go.

* `make install`

  If you have the proper permissions, you can run `make install` and the 
  `leg` directory with the source files will be put in a specific path. 
  Tweak Makefile's LUA_LIB variable to indicate the appropriate path for your 
  system; Makefile ships with it set to /usr/local/share/lua/5.1 .
  
* by hand

  If you don't have or don't want to use `make`, you can just put all the 
  files in `src` inside a directory called `leg`, and put that directory in 
  your LUA_PATH.

  Read the Lua Reference Manual for the LUA_PATH and the LUA_CPATH syntax
  (http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-package.path).

Work to do
----------

* Improve error checking: currently it is bolted on and not extensible, and 
  different patterns react differently to mismatching: scanner.STRING throws 
  an error when a mismatch happens, but some errors simply return false and an
  error message. I don't know a good way to handle this.

* A better API for grammar extensions. The current one is very ad hoc, and
  requires some fine tuning to make sure it works correctly. Metalua's API 
  seems interesting, and was originally based on Parsec. Investigation is 
  under way.

* More thorough testing.
